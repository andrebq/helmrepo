# couchdb helm chart

A simple and incomplete couchdb chart which currently works for single
node instances.

Assumes that longhorn storage is installed in the target kubernetes
cluster, for now this repo is mostly for my use, hence the lack of
in-depth documentation (as I can just read the code).

## Testing

There is a Makefile with useful targets, read them.
